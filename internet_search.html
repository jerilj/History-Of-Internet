        <h3>The True Story of the Internet- Internet Search Part 2</h3>
        <img src="Search.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 50%;">

 <p class="lead">
            In the 90’s it was hard to find the information you wanted online. Many companies tried to do it to a
            certain extent but couldn't succeed. In the late 90’s the page was full of plain text and images. It was
            hard to find useful information.
        </p>

         <p class="lead">
            Then came Yahoo. The founders of Yahoo were searching online ways to find a Basketball fantasy game. They
            found a way to aggregate data from other websites and extract information. The venture capitalist Sequoia
            Capital funded Yahoo. Yahoo founders were worried about advertising in search engines and how it is going to
            impact the users. But they went ahead with it and it helped them to make money besides the banner ads. More
            and more advertisers started using Yahoo for advertisements. That is how others realized that they can make
            money on the web.
        </p>

         <p class="lead">
            A company called Excite came up with a better way to search using keywords compared to Yahoo. The search
            engine competition increased, engaging more and more people. But too much focus on money and advertisement
            backfired. Even the search results were not accurate and useful.
        </p>

         <p class="lead">
            Few years later Google came up with an algorithm for link counting, to improve the accuracy of search
            results and its quality. Google became popular and a venture capitalist introduced them to Excite. But
            Excite didn't buy Google.Google later got investments from venture capitalists. The venture capitalists were
            skeptical about Google's future. Google became popular and it didn't have any advertisement on the page to
            make money.
        </p>


 <p class="lead">
            Instead of using banner advertisements, Google took the search keywords typed by users and transformed it
            into useful information that could be used for the market. Companies were willing to pay good money to get
            the information about what customers want.Google got this idea from a company called Overture.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Google refined this idea and incorporated it in their search engine. They came up with advertisements, paid
            links to websites that will fit nicely to the search results page. Google helped to improve the internet
            economy. Google's went public in 2004. Few years later Google became one of the most popular and profitable
            companies. They invested their money in things other than search engines. They bought so many other
            companies and expanded their business. But eventually people become worried about the data collected by
            google and the related privacy issues.

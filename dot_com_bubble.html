        <h3>The True Story of the Internet- Dot Com Bubble Part 3</h3>

        <p class="lead">
            In the year on 1993 release of Mosaic and other web browsers gave the computer users WWW (World Wide Web).The internet use increased as a result the interest 
            rate decreased and the availability of capital increased. The percentage of household in US owning computers increased drastically as the ownership changed 
            from luxury to necessity. As the result of the two factors, many investors were eager to invest in any Dot-Com company.The two companies Amazon.com and eBay 
            were biggest revolutionary companies that came forward in 1990’s. Earlier the Industrial Revolution corporations were based on the power of the executives 
            whereas the average consumer was not considered that much. But Amazon and eBay introduced new business model based on internet and targeting the mass of the individuals of the average customers.

            Amazon.com was started in suburban Seattle and if owned by the richest in the world Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos was working at Wall Street in a variety of fields. 
            He was highly analytical. After the introduction of web Jeff started analysing the potential of the World Wide Web. Jeff started looking for thing he can sell
            in internet but on the top of the list he always preferred books. On the other hand in Silicon Valley another person named “Pierre Omidyar” (CEO eBay) who was 
            a software programmer. The common thing in Pierre and Jeff was they took internet as a place of to do business. But they both were very different, Jeff was
            all about business plan analysing the market whereas Pierre had no clue about the market trend and was just a software coder.

            The major success came to both the sites within months of the launch. eBay was earning thousands of dollars in fees. Within first month of Amazon, 
            they shipped to 45 countries and all the states in US. The tremendous development of the companies was noticed by Wall Street. The increase in 
            internet was defined by two laws Moore’s law and Metcalfe’s law. Both of the laws state the similar outputs, as the number of users’ increases the 
            usefulness of network increases.

        <p class="lead">
           A breakthrough technology creates scads of risky start-ups and investors rush in to buy a piece of the company.
            The internet cycle started in 1995 when Netscape launched it very successful initial public offering on the stock market. 
            After a year IPO’s and search engine companies came in. Amazon also participated in Bubble hood in May 1997. Jeff Bezos self-claimed

        <p class="lead">
            The day traders started making the stock market look like a low rent casino. The day traders are the people who buy stocks in the morning and 
            sell then in the evening before the market close. The day trader invested a lot of time analysing market lurking in internet stock chartrooms,
            but most of the time they use TV for the information on the stocks.

        <p class="lead">
            With increase in the value of Amazon and eBay, many new companies were started with not so good business plan. Companies like pet calm, pet smart, pet utopia etc., 
            and these company got bankrupt soon. Apart from ecommerce telecommunication was booming as the growth on internet grew to maintain the need of bandwidth. 
            In 2000 Naqdaq fell 355 in which index was fallen 25% the highest drop in the history on trade market. After 9/11 many of the tech giants lost a large part 
            of their profits.  But few of the companies survived the drop and came out strong Amazon, eBay are the two of the biggest and the strongest.

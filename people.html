        <p class="lead">
           The Internet has changed society and a new breed of entrepreneurs is shaping the digital future. The
            communication was uprising all around us. New generation companies like YouTube, MySpace and Facebook,
            turned the web into a two way participatory and democratic medium controlled by no-one and shaped by everyone.
            It was termed as Web 2.0 time when the World Wide Web sites emphasized on user generated content and social 
            networking. Towards the end of the episode, the Founder of Craigslist says: “The web is not just about making
            money, it’s about setting communication free.”

            like Napster created a platform to share files and music without buying cd. Music industry filed a case 
            against Napster and in 2001 Napster was banned. Music Company won the case. Although they encouraged 
            apple to create iTunes music where songs were sold 99 cents apiece with copyright protection which made 
            companies music labels happy.

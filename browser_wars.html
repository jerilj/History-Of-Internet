        <h3>The True Story of the Internet- Browser Wars Part 1</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            In 1993 world wide web was hard to use and find information. Marc Andressen developed Mosaic browser to
            help individuals use the World Wide Web by adding images,videos etc. It was released for free in 1993. Jim
            Clarke started Netscape with the Mosaic browser team. When they started working on Netscape they faced
            competition from Bill Gates. IN 1993 90% of world PCs were running microsoft software. The tech giants like
            IBM couldn't compete with Microsoft. Microsoft was very vigorous about the competition and they wanted to
            crush Netscape.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Netscape Communications was one of the fastest growing companies ever made. The founder of Mosaic developed
            the Netscape browser. Microsoft was aware about Netscape and they tried to bring them in. But Netscape
            wasn’t interested in working with Microsoft. The Netscape browser was a success instantly and it worried
            Microsoft.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            People started seeing browsers as an alternative to Windows OS. This made Microsoft compete with Netscape.
            Microsoft met with Netscape in 1995 and tried to buy Netscape for $1 million. That way Microsoft broke the
            law by using their monopoly to crush other companies.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Netscape went public faster than other companies and made a lot of money. They often criticized Microsoft
            softwares . Netscape was immensely popular and no one thought Microsoft or anyone could compete with it.
            This made Microsoft align all their resources against the Netscape. Microsoft came up with Internet
            Explorer.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Microsoft used their influence to force computer manufacturers not to install Netscape and only install
            Internet Explorer by default. Microsoft gave away Internet explorers for free with their operating system.
            By 1997 Microsoft won the browser war and Netscape found it hard to compete with free Internet explorers by
            charging a fee to customers for their products. A year later AOL acquired netscape. Jim Clarke and other
            Netscape founders millions of dollars.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Though the browser war was over Microsoft had to face the US department of justice lawsuit because of the
            antitrust violations. Microsoft was announced guilty by the judge and Microsoft had to be broken down that
            was later reversed in an appeal.However, Microsoft lost its value and Bill Gates left the CEO position to do
            philanthropic work.

        <h3>History Channel - The Invention of the Internet</h3>

    <p class="lead">
            The internet is the most important part of our life today. It gave the United States advantage during the
            war time.One third of the United States’ economic growth in 1999 was due to the internet. The internet
            played a huge role in keeping corporations and small businesses running during the covid-19 pandemic. It is
            amazing to see something that is not being controlled by one person can play such a crucial role in the
            lives of billions of people
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The history of the internet dates back to the 1950’s; the early years of the cold war. The nuclear arms race
            and the space race lead to many government programs to invent new telecommunication technologies. The US
            government started ARPA to compete with Russians in the space race during the cold war. They identified that
            the United States needs a better communication network in case of a nuclear attack.

            The packet switching theory by Leonard Kleinrock of MIT in 1961 played a crucial role in transferring data
            through the network. The idea of queuing packets helped to determine the speed of transfer and to control
            its flow. The early research was about making sure that the packets were delivered without failure. Each
            packet was given a header with the information about where it should go. The packet finds a way to reach a
            node.A node knows the next node to forward the packet. The node keeps the packet info until the packet
            reaches the next node. Therefore even if the packet is lost it can resend it.

            Before the internet a person had to move from terminal to terminal to reach each computer. The researchers
            wanted to create a network that connects computers together and do resource sharing and file sharing by
            logging into remote computers.The first internet was between two ARPANET sites – UCLA and Stanford Research
            Institute in 1962 by Larry Roberts.In 1972 Bob Kahn demonstrated ARPANET at the International Computer
            Communication Conference (ICCC).

            Larry Roberts connected the first computers through the internet . He needed better software to talk to
            different types of computers. The initial plan was to create mini computers in the network. The idea was to
            take a long document and split it into packets and send it to the destination through the network of
            computers. The last computer puts the packets together.
            Larry Roberts asked IBM and ATT to build the packet switching but they refused. Finally a company called BBN
            took this challenge. They handled the engineering problems like controlling and tracing the packets. The
            UCLA professors , grad students and staff wrote the software.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            By 1970 APRPANET had 18 mainframes connected on the network.During the early years it was only used to share
            files. In March 1972, Ray Tomlinson, wrote the first basic email program using “@” .The Internet had open
            architecture and the inventors requested comments from anyone on how to improve it. The universities started
            sharing information using the internet. So many people contributed to improve the internet. NSF wanted
            researchers to have computer Networks in order to get grant money. The growth of the internet and multiple
            networks led to the creation of TCP IP protocol. A gateway is needed to help two networks to talk to each
            other.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            For many years the internet was only used for defense research. In 1993 the congress passed a law to make
            the internet public. The America online internet, invention of the world wide web by Tim Bernes in 1990 and
            the Mosaic browser by Marc Andressen started the next phase of the Internet.
